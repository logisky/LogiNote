# LogiNote

LogiNote is a pioneering English learning software specifically designed for Chinese speakers.
Our core philosophy is to harness the power of articles for learning sentences and, subsequently, use those sentences to learn words.
This innovative approach aims to cultivate a profound understanding of English, fostering accurate concepts in the learner's mind.

## Philosophy Behind LogiNote

Learning a new language is more than just memorizing vocabulary;
it's about understanding the context, the culture, and the nuances that make the language alive.
LogiNote is built on the belief that to truly grasp a language, one must start with the bigger picture—articles
and sentences—before diving into the individual words.
This method ensures that learners are not just memorizing but truly understanding and absorbing the language in a way that feels natural and intuitive.
